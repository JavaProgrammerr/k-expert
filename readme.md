Hi there.
This is the test task fow QA role
I use Java+Selenium+Serenity

To run test on your env you need to:
1. Clone repo
2. If you use linux modify 'serenity.properties' file line 'webdriver.chrome.driver=driver/chromedriver'
3. Run 'maven verify'

And after run pls check reports here ./target/site/serenity/index.html
